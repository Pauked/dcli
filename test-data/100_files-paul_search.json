Plenty of teleporting surprises so watch your back. The exit is located in the middle of the map around a nukage moat, you must raise a bridge to get out of this level.",

This strikes me as a good premise for a mapping challenge - what do you think?<br><br> Everything done in this wad should have a vanilla workaround, but this would work better as a Boom contest for the extra capability.<br><br> Reviewers: try not to judge this as an actual level.

There is also a special third area you can fight or run through.<br><br>\n\nWhat is different about this Wad that 300 others don't have? Hint: look at the ceiling, :)<br><br>\n\n1. No bottlenecks: every spot has at least two exits; you can't be locked down. You also have to watch at least two places for enemies.<br><br>\n\n2. Better weapons selection: if you select the first two weapons levels, only shotgun, chainsaw and pistol are available. At level 3, chaingun is available and at level 4, rocket launcher is available. Why do this? We found in playing deathmatch, that the game became too easy with the plasma rifle or rocket launcher all the time. It also made the game's outcome depend on whoever got to the biggest weapon first.<br><br>\n\nShotgun and Pistol can be evaded. Plasma gun makes getting killed too easy. Rockets can kill just from the blast wave. The reduction in firepower makes the game more interesting since even an inexperienced player can do killing damage to a seasoned veteran.<br><br>\n\nAn inexperienced player is no match against a more experienced one even with equal high- powered weaponary. This also makes the game more fun since you never know what will happen.",

        "description": "This is a little level which I made soon after my first couple of deathmatches it originally was intended to mimic the mood and feel of the first doom2 level, but soon after putting half of it down on paper, I had a stunning idea, although it will hoepfully be good for deathmatch it also has a severe sting in the tail for single and coop play. I do not advise coop play as there is really only enough ammo for 1 player and 4 deathmatchers, even then the DMers may come up short. The Dehacked patch is essential for play as single play and coop. It's not so important for DM but it will be annoying for them if the patch isn't implimented.",

There are very few 'quick' frags when playing but rather each battle is normally a sustained test of dodging and and firing skills. Some people have commented that it is too easy for the wounded to simply run away. Well there is no 'simply' running away with this wad - mouse users will particularily like the long corridors down which can be chased the wounded opponent firing away at their back with the gattling gun. And transports, well we all know the hazards of using transports when the opponent is nearby.<br><br> This wad is the culmation of about six months of playing two player DM with many people. (At the time of release it has not yet been played by 3 or 4 player ... though it should be very good for that - i'ts quite large)<br><br> There is an exit ... try not to use it until you actually want to exit.",

        "description": "Updated version of Dark Encounters megawad. Fixes/Changes:<br><br> All difficulty settings are now available (previously implemented HMP and UV only). Replaced all \"thing\" actions with linedef actions or scripts for better compatiblity with mods. Fixed issues with co-op players becoming stuck behind closing doors/walls etc. Any lock outs/ins where the player has no other way out/in will be on a reasonable timer. Adjusted/added monster and ammo count for co-op and, to a lesser degree, in single player. Map01 chainsaw secret now recognized by mods that did not trigger it. Map06 Removed several burning barrels that were causing performance issues with some mods. Map09 Yellow Key no longer triggers lowering sector twice, trapping the player. Map13 Red Door is now set as repeatable action. Map20 removed some invisible blocking lines that impeded player movement. Map26 moved shootable switch as players were often getting stuck here. Map31 added more monsters to final battle as it was underwhelming. Increased font size on HUD messages. Mouse look is REQUIRED for a few secrets and shootable switches. (This was incorrectly listed as \"mouse look recommended\")",

I am releasing it as a playable demo to generate a little more buzz on my project.It may be while for that final release, so in the meantime, please enjoy Fury Rising. Any questions or concerns can be addressed either on my doomworld thread or email. --------------------------------- Style-Style wise, i'm not sure what Fury Rising resembles. At first I was going for that classic, simplistic look and feel. Now, its something else entirly. If I had to pin it down, I would have to say its part slaughter map, part horror survival. As you play through the level, you'll notice some parts of it are off limits. That is because fury rising is also part of another level. Also, I neglected to put in any secrets. I already stuffed in enough goodies to make up for that though. ------------------------------------- Thanks for reading, and doom on fellow doomers!",

No bottlenecks: every spot has at least two exits; you can't be locked down. You also have to watch at least two places for enemies.<br><br>\n\n2. Better weapons selection: if you select the first two weapons levels, only shotgun, chainsaw and pistol are available. At level 3, chaingun is available and at level 4, rocket launcher is available. Why do this? We found in playing deathmatch, that the game became too easy with the plasma rifle or rocket launcher all the time. It also made the game's outcome depend on whoever got to the biggest weapon first.<br><br>\n\nShotgun and Pistol can be evaded. Plasma gun makes getting killed too easy. Rockets can kill just from the blast wave. The reduction in firepower makes the game more interesting since even an inexperienced player can do killing damage to a seasoned veteran.<br><br>\n\nAn inexperienced player is no match against a more experienced one even with equal high- powered weaponary. This also makes the game more fun since you never know what will happen.",

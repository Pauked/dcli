# Doom CLI v0.1

Flow on first use:
 - Find/pick engines
 - Find/pick IWADS
 - Pick paths for user WADs

Settings / Profiles
 - Think about how profiles work in App.toml.
 - Profiles for environment (Mac, Windows)
 - Profiles for WADS and Engine combos.

What do I want in the config?
 - List of engines...
 - List of editors...
 - List of wads played
 - Wad profiles of engine and wad

 What do I want from the app?
 - Play last engine and wad
 - To track wads played
 - To track time played at a WAD and Engine level
 - Have last played based on machine name

Orginal thoughts:
- Windows support
- MacOs support
- Ability to pick wad to play
- Ability to pick engine to use
- Ability to pick map editor
- Ability to run Doom
    - With IWAD
    - With User WAD
    - To play demo
    - To open on map level at difficulty
- Run engine with PLAY settings
- Run map editor
- Track amount of time playing. Record against WAD
- Short arg options
- Short cmd options in CLI
- Built in mini-WIKI of Doom help.
    - Weapon stats, monster stats
